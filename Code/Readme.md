# Simple code documentation

## Overview
This repository contains R and python code used for the project 

## Language
The code is written in R and python, those languages and environments are for statistical computing and graphics. R and python both provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques that are highly extensible.

## Files

- [`Expansion_Pomzp3.R`](Expansion_Pomzp3.R) This script reads multiple CSV files, filters rows based on certain criteria, and outputs the results into a new CSV file. It utilizes the `tidyverse` collection of R packages for data manipulation and cleaning.

- [`Gene_exapnsions.py`](Gene_exapnsions.py) The script processes gene expression data, constructs a directed graph using NetworkX, visualizes the graph, selects subgraphs based on specific criteria, and saves relevant data into CSV files for further analysis.

- [`filter_LASSO_relax.Rmd`](filter_LASSO_relax.Rmd) Reads gene expression data from "CPM_HS_LASSO_relax.csv", filters it based on specific criteria for different datasets ("Pre_B_HS", "Pediatric vs adult HS", "Pre_T_HS", "subtypeT_HS", and "TumorvsControl_HS"), and saves the filtered datasets into separate CSV files.
